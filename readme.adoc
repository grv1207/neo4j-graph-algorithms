// tag::readme[]

This project aims to develop efficient, well tested graph algorithm implementations for Neo4j 3.1 and 3.2.

Releases are available here: https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-graph-algorithms/releases

The goal is to provide parallel versions of common graph algorithms for Neo4j exposed as Cypher user defined procedures:

Centralities:

* Page Rank
* Betweenness Centrality
* Closeness Centrality

Graph Partitioning:

// * Louvain
* Label Propagation
* (Weakly) Connected Components
* Strongly Connected Components

Path Finding:

* Minimum Weight Spanning Tree
* All Pairs- and Single Source - Shortest Path

These procedures work on a subgraphm optionally filtered by label and relationship-type. 
Future versions will also provide filtering and projection using Cypher queries.

*We'd love your feedback*, so please try out these algorithms and let us know how well they work for your use-case. 
Also please note things that you miss from installation instructions, readme, etc. 

Please raise https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-graph-algorithms/issues[GitHub issues] for anything you encounter or join the http://neo4j.com/developer/slack[neo4j-users Slack group] and ask in the `#neo4j-graph-algorithm` channel.

== Installation

Just copy the `graph-algorithms-algo-*.jar` from https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-graph-algorithms/releases[the matching release] into your `$NEO4J_HOME/plugins` directory and restart Neo4j.

Then running `call dbms.procedures();` should also list the algorithm procedures.

[source,cypher]
----
CALL dbms.procedures() YIELD name, description, signature
WHERE name STARTS WITH "algo."
RETURN name, description, signature
ORDER BY name
----

[WARNING]
====
For safety reasons, in *Neo4j 3.2.x* you will need to add/enable this line in your `$NEO4J_HOME/conf/neo4j.conf`:

----
dbms.security.procedures.unrestricted=algo.*
----
====

== Usage

These algorithms are exposed as Neo4j procedures.
You can call them directly from Cypher in your Neo4j Browser, from cypher-shell or your client code.

For most algorithms there are two procedures, one that writes results back to the graph as node-properties and another (named `algo.<name>.stream`) that returns a stream of data, e.g. node-ids and computed values.

The general call syntax is:

[source,cypher]
----
CALL algo.<name>([label],[relType],{config})
----

For example for page rank on dbpedia:

[source,cypher]
----
CALL algo.pageRank('Page','Link',{iterations:5, dampingFactor:0.85, write: true, writeProperty:'pagerank'});
// YIELD nodes, iterations, loadMillis, computeMillis, writeMillis, dampingFactor, write, writeProperty

CALL algo.pageRank.stream('Page','Link',{iterations:5, dampingFactor:0.85})
YIELD node, score
RETURN node, score
ORDER BY score DESC LIMIT 10;
----

=== Cypher Loading

If label and relationship-type are not selective enough to describe your subgraph to run the algorithm on, you can use Cypher statements to load or project subsets of your graph.
Then use a node-statement instead of the label parameter and a relationship-statement instead of the relationship-type and use `graph:'cypher'` in the config.

You can also return a property value or weight (according to your config) in addition to the id's from these statements.

[source,cypher]
----
CALL algo.pageRank(
'MATCH (p:Page) RETURN id(p) as id',
'MATCH (p:Page)-[:Link]->(p2:Page) RETURN id(p1) as source, id(p2) as target',
{graph:'cypher', iterations:5, write: true});

== Building

Currently aiming at Neo4j 3.1 and 3.2 (in the 3.2 branch)

----
git clone https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-graph-algorithms
cd neo4j-graph-algorithms
mvn clean install
cp algo/target/graph-algorithms-*.jar $NEO4J_HOME/plugins/
$NEO4J_HOME/bin/neo4j restart
